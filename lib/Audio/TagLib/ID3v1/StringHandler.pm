=head1 NAME

Audio::TagLib::ID3v1::StringHandler - A abstraction for the string to data
encoding in ID3v1 tags. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ID3v1 should in theory always contain ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) data. In
practise it does not. Audio::TagLib by default only supports ISO-8859-1 data
in ID3v1 tags.

However by subclassing this class and reimplementing parse() and
render() and setting your reimplementation as the default with
ID3v1::Tag::setStringHandler() you can define how you would like these
transformations to be done. 

B<WARNING> It is advisable B<NOT> to write non-ISO-8859-1 data to
ID3v1 tags. Please consider disabling the writing of ID3v1 tags in the
case that the data is ISO-8859-1.

see I<L<ID3v1::Tag::setStringHandler()|Audio::TagLib::ID3v1::Tag>>

=over

=item I<L<String|Audio::TagLib::String>
parse(L<ByteVector|Audio::TagLib::ByteVector> $data)> 

Decode a string from $data. The default implementation assumes that
$data is an ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character array.

=item I<ByteVector|Audio::TagLib::ByteVector> render(L<String|Audio::TagLib::String>
$s)> 

Encode a ByteVector with the data from $s. The default implementation
assumes that $s is an ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) string.

B<WARNING> It is recommended that you B<NOT> override this method, but
instead do not write an ID3v1 tag in the case that the data is not
ISO-8859-1.

None by default.
