=head1 NAME

Audio::TagLib::MPC::File - An implementation of Audio::TagLib::File with MPC
specific methods 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Audio::TagLib;
  
  my $i = Audio::TagLib::MPC::File->new("sample mpc file.mpc");
  print $i->tag()->title()->toCString(), "\n"; # got title

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This implements and provides an interface for MPC files to the
Audio::TagLib::Tag and Audio::TagLib::AudioProperties interfaces by way of
implementing the abstract Audio::TagLib::File API as well as providing some
additional information specific to MPC files.

The only invalid tag combination supported is an ID3v1 tag after an
APE tag. 

=over

=item I<new(PV $file, BOOL $readProperties = TRUE, PV $propertiesStyle
= "Average")>

Constructs an MPC file from $file. If $readProperties is true the
file's audio properties will also be read using $propertiesStyle. If
false, $propertiesStyle is ignored.

=item I<DESTROY()>

Destroys this instance of the File.

=item I<L<Tag|Audio::TagLib::Tag> tag()>

Returns the Tag for this file.  This will be an APE tag, an ID3v1 tag
or a combination of the two.

=item I<L<Properties|Audio::TagLib::MPC::Properties> audioProperties()>

Returns the MPC::Properties for this file. If no audio properties were
read then this will return undef.

=item I<BOOL save()>

Save the file.

=item I<L<ID3v1::Tag|Audio::TagLib::ID3v1::Tag> ID3v1Tag(BOOL $create =
FALSE)>

Returns the ID3v1 tag of the file.

If $create is false (the default) this will return undef if there is
 no valid ID3v1 tag. If $create is true it will create an ID3v1 tag if
 one does not exist. If there is already an APE tag, the new ID3v1 tag
 will be placed after it.

 B<NOTE> The Tag is B<STILL> owned by the APE::File and should not be
 deleted by the user. It will be deleted when the file (object) is
 destroyed. 

=item I<L<APE::Tag|Audio::TagLib::APE::Tag> APETag(BOOL $create = FALSE)>

Returns the APE tag of the file.

If $create is false (the default) this will return undef if there is
no valid APE tag. If $create is true it will create a APE tag if one
does not exist. If there is already an ID3v1 tag, the new APE tag will
be placed before it.

B<NOTE> The Tag is B<STILL> owned by the APE::File and should not be
deleted by the user. It will be deleted when the file (object) is
destroyed. 

=item I<void remove(PV $tags = "ALLTags")>

This will remove the tag that matches TagTypes from the file. By
default it removes all tags.

B<NOTE> This will also invalidate pointers to the tags as their memory
will be freed.

B<NOTE> In order to make the removal permanent save() still needs to
be called. 

=item %_TagTypes

Deprecated. See L<tag_types()|tag_tyes()>

=item = tag_types()

This set of flags is used for various operations. C<keys
%{Audio::TagLib::MPC::File::tag_types()}> lists all available values used in Perl
code. 

B<WARNING> The values are not allowed to be OR-ed together in Perl.

=back

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
