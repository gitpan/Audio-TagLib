This was file "Bugs" in v 1.4
Known bugs in libtag.so.1.5
------------------------------

With  the exceptopn of the last, no effort has been made to verify these in
later versions of taglib.

o  TagLib::ID3v2::UserTextIdentificationFrame::find static, thus not exported
o  TagLib::ID3v2::ByteVectorList. toByteVector->data reviving a split.
    where there was a string ' x '. The x is lost.
    See t/TagLib_ByteVectorList.t.
o   Some mp3 version1 files using a sample rate of 44100 will nevertheless
    get an 'Invalid sample rate' error. Perhaps a badly constructed file?
     mpegheader.cpp, 235.
o   TagLib::File::writeBlock() does not +w on -w file, fails instead
o   File properties, such as +w, are acquired when the FileRef is created.
    Subsequent mods outside tablib are not noticed.
o   Audio::TagLib::FLAC::File::ID3v2Tag(1) succeeds, but then after the
    file is saved, subsequent excutions result in the message:
     TagLib: FLAC::File::save()
     This can't be right -- an ID3v2 tag after the start of the FLAC bytestream?
     Not writing the ID3v2 tag
o   id3v2framefactory.cpp, 104. <= should be changed to !=
