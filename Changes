Revision history for Perl extension TagLib.

1.55  Sat Aug  4 09:28:40 PDT 2012
    -  Compile errors: in xs/apeitem.xs do_open, do_close cause problems, not used

1.54 Wed Aug  1 11:56:54 PDT 2012
    - CPAN testing revealed what appears to be an implementation-dependent
      result in t/TagLib_ByteVector.t. That test has been deleted.
    - A number of tests were in TODO: blocks. I expected that they
      would be ignored, but it appears that some of the statements
      resulted in errors that were not ignored. All of these blocks,
      including the error above have geen enlosed in =if 0 ... =cut
    - Finally, a test in t/TagLib_ID3v2_FrameList.t had a race condition
      resulting from a failure to use parens. 

1.52 Tue Jul 31 08:33:24 PDT 2012
    - Corrected Makefile.PL error

1.51 Wed Jul 11 16:21:06 PDT 2012
    - Begin testing with taglib 1.7.2
    - Looks good, except that I haven't covered new functionality

1.50 Tue Jul 10 08:26:45 PDT 2012
    - Final

1.50.0 Sat Jan 22 15:41:45 PST 2011
    - Based on taglib v 1.5. As of this writing, taglib is at v1.6.3,
       consequently it's unlikely that this will be of much use to anyone.
       It's being released as a checkpoint on the way to supporting that release.
       Only fatal bugs will be addressed on this thread.
    - While all of the tests pass, it's not guaranteed that all of the
      TagLib functionality has been tested. YMMV!
    - Add Audio:: to MODULE and DISTRIBUTION statements in xs/*
        used script fix_dcls.pl
    - Updated ppport.h
    - Cleaned auto-inserted comments from t/*
    - Fixed coding errors in t/*
    - Swapped in guitar.* in sample/; adds .wav and .flac
        Produced from guitar.wav using Audacity. Where guitar.wav came 
        from is anybody's guess
